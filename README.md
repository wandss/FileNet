# FileNet
This repository will host programs related to IBM's FileNet P8, an ECM/BPM system.

The first program (PDF-PagesCount-FromFileNet.py) is a PDF page counter. It counts the number of pages from PDF files already 
stored in IBM FileNet P8 and save this data in FileNet Database. As far as I concern in FileNet's Database is only possible to 
know how many documents are in the system, but not how many pages, so with this program you can have an important new metadata
at your dispoasal.
I hope this program can help people as much as it is helping me now.
